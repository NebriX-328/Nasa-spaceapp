"NebriX – AI-Powered Exoplanet Detection Platform"

NebriX is an AI/ML-powered web application designed to identify exoplanets using NASA’s open-source Kepler, K2, and TESS datasets. The platform combines machine learning with an interactive web interface to make exoplanet discovery accessible for both researchers and enthusiasts.

🚀 Project Overview

The NASA Space Apps Challenge inspires solutions using NASA’s open data.
NebriX addresses the challenge:

“Create an AI/ML model trained on NASA’s exoplanet datasets to identify new exoplanets, with a user-friendly web interface.”

🎯 Objectives

Develop an AI model to classify celestial data into:
✅ Confirmed Exoplanets
⚠ Candidates
❌ False Positives

Create a web interface for dataset upload, analysis, and result visualization

Support real-time interaction and visualization of predictions

🧠 Tech Stack

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Design: TailwindCSS / Custom CSS
Backend (Planned): Python (Flask / FastAPI) for ML model integration
Visualization: Chart.js / Plotly.js
Data Sources: NASA Kepler, K2, and TESS open datasets
